# Petra Portfolio

Headless portfolio platform with Drupal as CMS/backend and a JavaScript frontend.

## Architecture
- `backend/` — Drupal CMS (content modeling, editorial workflow, API exposure)
- `frontend/` — JS frontend app consuming CMS APIs
- `infra/` — local/dev environment and deployment helpers

## Planned Stack
- Backend: Drupal (headless)
- Frontend: JavaScript framework (to be finalized)

## Getting Started
This repository is currently in scaffold phase.

### Next Steps
1. Bootstrap Drupal backend in `backend/`
2. Choose frontend framework and scaffold `frontend/`
3. Define content model and API contracts
4. Add CI checks and environment setup
